Away for the day?  Are your children in school?If your child needs non-emergency medical dental or surgical services whether in a doctor’s office or in the hospital you as a parent must give permission.What about times when you cannot be reached for permission?In an emergency your child may be treated without your consent if a physician determines that your child needs immediate medical care and further delay would increase the risk to your child’s life or health.  In situations that are not emergencies your child may need unexpected care.  In these cases contacting parents for permission can delay treatment and create unnecessary anxiety or discomfort for your child.How can you prepare for the unexpected care your children might need when you are away?ÿ Make sure the person who is caring for your children knows how to reach you at all times.ÿ When you can't come with your children to medical appointments or know you will be hard to reach you may legally delegate your authority to give permission to other adults to authorize medical care for your children.The form Temporary Delegation of Parental Rights and Limited Power of Attorney for Consent to Treatment of Your Child is a legal document.  Under Michigan law MCLA § 700.5103(2005):ÿ A parent or guardian of a minor or a guardian of a legally incapacitated adult may delegate to another person for up to 6 months any of the parent's or guardian's powers regarding care custody or property of the minor child or ward except the power to consent to marriage or adoption of a minor ward or to release of a minor ward for adoption.ÿ If a parent or guardian is serving in the armed forces of the United States and is deployed to a foreign nation a delegation under this law may be effective longer than 6 months until the thirty-first day after the end of the deployment if the delegation letter specifically permits the longer period.ÿ The following applies only if a parent is not signing the form: if a legal guardian for a minor or legally incapacitated adult delegates any power under this law the guardian must notify the court that approved the guardianship within 7 days and provide the court the name address and telephone number of the new “attorney-in-fact.”The form’s purpose is to allow your child to receive necessary health care services when you the parent or guardian are unavailable to give written informed consent. ÿ Fill out this form carefully.  With it you may appoint relatives friends teachers neighbors or anyone you know and trust who is legally competent and over 18 years of age to authorize treatment in your absence.  ÿ After you complete the form give it to the adults you have designated and explain its use.  Make sure they know that they must take the form with them to the physician's or dentist's office or to the hospital or other health care facility.  ÿ The form will be entered into your child's medical chart so that it is available to other UMHHC providers and administrators with a need to know.In order to be effective the form must be signed by at least one parent and either a witness (not related to patient's family and not affiliated with UMHS) or a notary public.  The following additional guidelines are suggested to help ensure the form is used appropriately.ÿ Print neatly to ensure that all information is legible.  Use a blue or black ball point pen to ensure that information will not run smear or smudge.ÿ Print the full name of the minor as written in the minor's birth certificate insurance card and medical record.ÿ List all known allergies (e.g. medicines insects foods etc.) and medical conditions (e.g. asthma diabetes etc.)ÿ Either initial or line-out “... [ ] medical [ ] dental [ ] surgical care and/or [ ] hospitalization....” as you deem appropriate.ÿ Print all limitations to the general delegation of parental powers to consent to medical dental surgical care and/ or hospitalization. Ensure that the limitations are clear and specific (e.g. necessary surgery ok but no cosmetic procedures).  Note: It is essential that you trust the person you are appointing to make the decisions you would make under similar circumstances.ÿ Complete all blanks (e.g. if there are no known allergies write “none”).  Draw a line through any extra space at the end of each entry to ensure that nothing may be added at a later date.ÿ Have at least one (preferably both) parents sign the form and have a separate person  - not the parent(s) not a relative and not affiliated with UMHS  - witness the signature.

Clinical correlation is suggested.Test Result for Y ChromosomeNot detectedConsist  ent with a female fetus.Test Methodof anti-coagulated maternal whole blood. It was then converted into a genomic DNA library for the determination of chromosome 21 18 13 representation and the presence of the Y chromosome.1 Other chromosomal material including fetal chromosome 22 16 sex chromosome (X and Y) representation and select regions (22q 15q 11q 8q 5p 4p 1p) was also evaluated and will only be reported as an Additional Finding when an abnormality is detected.About the TestThe MaterniT21 PLUS test analyzes circulating cell-free DNA extracted from a maternal blood sample. The test is indicated for use in pregnant women with increased risk for chromosomal aneuploidy. Validation data on twin pregnancies is limited and the ability of this test to detect aneuploidy in a triplet pregnancy has not yet been validated.34-40200R1.0  T2  071414PerformanceThe performance characteristics of the MaterniT21 PLUS laboratory-developed test (LDT) have been determined in a clinical validation study with pregnant women at increased risk for fetal chromosomal abnormality.123Intended UsePerformance(95% CI)Trisomy 21Sensitivity:   99.1%96.3-99.8%99.6-99.9%Trisomy 18Sensitivity: >99.9%92.4-100.0%99.2-99.8%Trisomy 13Sensitivity:   91.7%59.7-99.6%99.3-99.9% Limitations of the Test individuals. Cell-free DNA does not replace the accuracy and precision of prenatal diagnosis with CVS or amniocentesis.A patient with a positive test result or presence of an Additional Finding should be referred for genetic counseling and offered 4 A negative test result does not ensure an unaffected pregnancy.  The absence of an Additional Finding does not indicate a negative result. While results of this testing are highly accurate not all chromosomal abnormalities may be detected due to placental maternal or fetal mosaicism or other causes. Sex chromosomal aneuploidies are not reportable for known multiple gestations. The health care provider is responsible for the use of this information in the management of their patient.NoteThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Sequenom Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. FDA. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as accredited by the College of American Pathologists.  References1. Palomaki GE et al. Genet Med. 2012;14(3):296-305.2.

Harmony® performs a directed analysis of cell-freeDNA (cfDNA) in maternal blood and incorporates the fetal fraction of cfDNA in test results. Testresults also incorporate maternal age (or egg donor age) and gestational age related probabilitybased on information provided on the test requisition form. Probability of less than 1% is definedas low probability and 1% or greater is defined as high probability. Harmony has been validated insingleton and twin pregnancies of at least 10 weeks gestational age. Harmony is not validated foruse in pregnancies with more than two fetuses demised twin mosaicism partial chromosomeaneuploidy translocations maternal aneuploidy transplant malignancy or in women under theage of 18. Harmony does not detect neural tube defects. Twin results reflect the probability thatthe pregnancy involves at least one affected fetus. Analysis of cfDNA does not always correlatewith fetal genotype. Not all aneuploid fetuses will have a high probability result and some euploidfetuses will have a high probability result. The Harmony Prenatal Test is not a diagnostic test andresults should be considered with other clinical criteria and communicated in a setting thatincludes appropriate counseling.T21T18T13CLINICAL DATADetection Rate> 99%(95% CI: 97.9-99.8%)97.4%(95% CI: 93.4-99.0%)93.8%(95% CI: 79.9-98.3%)False Positive Rate< 0.1%(95% CI: 0.02-0.08%)< 0.1%(95% CI: 0.01-0.05%)< 0.1%(95% CI: 0.01-0.06%)Detection and false positive (discordant result) rates based on probability cut-off of 1/100 (1%).Because these conditions are rare limited numbers of aneuploidy twin and egg donorpregnancies have been evaluated. The negative predictive value for trisomy 21 18 and 13 isgreater than 99%. Positive predictive value (PPV) varies by prevalence. The probability resultreported is not equivalent to the PPV.

An abnormal hybridization pattern is observed in 25 of 25 cells examined indicative of aneuploidy for chromosomes 3 7 17 and loss of the 9p21 locus.  This result is indicative of the continuing presence of urothelial carcinoma according to the UroVysion Directional Insert (Abbott Molecular/Vysis.  However positive FISH results are not conclusive of such as a single modality of evaluation.  A positive UroVysion result in the absence of other signs or symptoms of bladder cancer may be evidence of other urinary tract related  cancers  e.g.  ureter  urethra  renal  and/or  prostate  and  further  patient  follow-up  is  justified.    If  the  test  results  are  not consistent with the clinical findings a consultation between the pathologist and the treating physician is warranted.    The  UroVysion  test  was  designed  for  use  on  voided  urine  specimens  as  an  aid  for  the  initial  diagnosis of  bladder  carcinoma  in patients with hematuria and for subsequent monitoring for tumor recurrence in patients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer.  Results from the UroVysion test are intended for use in conjunction with and not in lieu of current standard diagnostic procedures.  The appropriate positive and negative controls were satisfactory.

A mixture of lymphocytes is isolated from the blood.2. These cells are grown in a defined culture medium containing optimal levels of all essential.nutrients necessary to sustain their growth in cell culture.3. The T-lymphocytes are stimulated to grow with a mitogen (phytohemagglutinin) and growth ismeasured by the incorporation of tritiated (radioactive) thymidine into the DNA of the cells.The growth response under optimal conditions is defined as 100% and all other growth rates arecompared to this 100% level of growth.For example – we remove vitamin B6 from the medium and stimulate the cells to grow by mitogenstimulation. Growth is measured by DNA synthesis and the rate of growth is dependent only upon thefunctional level of vitamin B6 available within the cells to support growth. For Vitamin B6 a growth rate of at least 55% of the growth rate observed in the optimal (100%) media is considered normal. Results lessthan 55% are considered to indicate a functional deficiency for Vitamin B6. Each nutrient has a differentreference range that was established by assaying thousands of apparently healthy individuals.BREAKING DOWN THE REPORT1. TEST RESULT (% CONTROL)This column represents the patient’s growth response in the test media measured by DNA synthesis as compared to the optimal growth observed in the 100% media.2. FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALSAn interpretation is provided for those nutrients found to be deficient.3. REFERENCE RANGEThis column represents how this patient’s result compares to thousands of patients previously tested.  A patient’s result is considered deficient when it is less than the referencerange.4. GRAPHSThe abnormal range of results is noted in the blue area. Abnormal results are indicated in red. The gray cross hatch area is a representation of the range of test results found in a random selection of subjects.SPECTROX® – TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT FUNCTIONSPECTROX® is a measurement of overall antioxidant function. The patient’s cells are grown in theoptimal media stimulated to grow and then increasing amounts of a free radical generatingsystem (H2O2) are added. The cell’s ability to resist oxidative damage is determined. Theincreasing levels of peroxide will result in diminished growth rates in those patients with poorantioxidant function capacity.INDIVIDUAL ANTIOXIDANT LEVELSIn the tests for individual antioxidants it is determined which specific antioxidants may be deficientand thus affecting the SPECTROX® antioxidant function result. For these tests the patient’s cellsare preincubated with one of the nutrient antioxidants i.e. selenium and then the Spectrox® test isrepeated to determine if the addition of selenium improves the patient’s antioxidant function. Thisprocess is repeated for each individual antioxidant.Antioxidants tested with this process:Glutathione Cysteine Coenzyme-Q10 Selenium Vitamin E and Alpha Lipoic AcidSpectraCell Laboratories Inc.Accession Number: M00001Laboratory Test ReportJanet DoeRepletion Suggestions1.

For example the oxidative damage to LDL-cholesterol appears to lead to the deposition ofcholesterol in the arterial wall leading to atherosclerotic disease.  In the past few years many other functions ofvitamin E have been clarified.  Alpha-tocopherol has direct effect on the control of inflammation red and whiteblood cell production connective tissue growth and genetic control of cell division.  Vitamin E acts to reduce freeradical damage by converting arachidonic acid free radicals to less harmful derivatives limiting formation ofpro-inflammatory cytokines.  In deficiencies of vitamin E arachidonic acid is converted to pro-inflammatoryleukotrienes and cytokines.  In neutralizing free radicals vitamin E is oxidized to a free radical.  Conversion backto the reduced form occurs by reaction with vitamin C (ascorbate).Deficiency Symptoms:The principle use of vitamin E is an antioxidant in the protection against heart disease cancer stroke andneurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer’s).  In addition alpha-tocopherol supplementation is useful in treating othercardiovascular diseases diabetes fibrocystic breast disease menopause symptoms and tardive dyskinesia.  It mayalso have applications in Parkinson’s Disease and arthritis.  Vitamin E is important to immune function protectingthymic function and white blood cells from oxidative stress.Symptoms of vitamin E deficiency include nerve damage muscle weakness poor coordination involuntary eyemovements red blood cell fragility anemia and retrolental fibroplasia (eye disease).Repletion Information:Vitamin E is available in many different formulations either natural or synthetic.  Natural forms of vitamin E aredesignated d- as in d-a-tocopherol.  Synthetic forms are designated as dl-.  The biologically active form of thevitamin is the d- form and it is recommended for supplementation over the dl- (synthetic) forms.  Beta-tocopherolgamma-tocopherol and the alpha- and delta-tocoretinols have less than 50% of the biological activity thand-a-tocopherol.The RDA for vitamin E (d-a-tocopherol) is set at 15 I.U. per day.  The amount of vitamin E required is dependentupon the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet.  The more polyunsaturated fat in the diet the greater the risk foroxidative damage and the vitamin E requirement is increased.  Most studies have utilized doses between 200-400I.U. per day.  Some studies report effective use of vitamin E at doses up to 3000 I.U. per day without observed sideeffects over a two-year period.Laboratory Test ReportSpectraCell Laboratories Inc.Accession Number:GlutathioneStatus:The patient’s lymphocytes have shown a deficient status for Glutathione.Function:Glutathione is implicated in many cellular functions including antioxidant protection and detoxification.  Itis also essential for the maintenance of cell membrane integrity in red blood cells.  Intracellular glutathioneconcentrations are principally derived by intracellular synthesis as few cells directly uptake glutathione from thesurrounding extracellular fluid.  The high concentration of glutathione in virtually all cells clearly indicates itsimportance in metabolic and oxidative detoxification processes.  Glutathione may be considered the preeminentantioxidant.Deficiency Symptoms:A wide range of human conditions such as aging cancer atherosclerosis arthritis viral infections AIDScardiovascular neurodegenerative diseases and pulmonary diseases may be produced or made worse by “freeradicals”.  Their treatment or prevention often includes antioxidants such as vitamin C vitamin E carotenoids andselenium.   Glutathione is an essential component of the antioxidant defense system: producing a sparing effectfor both tocopherol and ascorbate by reducing the oxidized forms and by eliminating hydrogen peroxide byreacting with glutathione peroxidase.  Cellular glutathione functions to decrease the formation of oxidized LDLimplicated in the development of atherosclerosis.  T-lymphocytes become deficient in glutathione in theprogression of AIDS which impairs immune function.  Glutathione is also required for the synthesis of someprostaglandins from n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are important in the inflammatory response.Patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome are favorably affected by treatments that increase cellularglutathione.Repletion Information:Glutathione is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and foods rich in glutathione do not appear tocontribute to increases in intracellular glutathione levels.  Cysteine appears to be the limiting amino acid in theintracellular synthesis of glutathione and supplementation with up to 2000 mg daily of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteineappears safe.  Supplementation with cysteine is not recommended as it may be poorly tolerated by many patients.In addition it may be rapidly oxidized to L-cystine a less usable form for the synthesis of glutathione.  Foods richin cysteine are generally high protein foods such as meats yogurt wheat germ and eggs.Laboratory Test ReportSpectraCell Laboratories Inc.Accession Number:Oleic AcidStatus:The patient’s lymphocytes have shown a deficient status for Oleic Acid (long-chain monounsaturatedfatty acid)Function:Oleic acid is the most common monounsaturated fatty acid in human cells.  Oleic acid is incorporated into cellmembrane phospholipids where it is important for important for proper membrane fluidity.  Hormoneresponsiveness infectivity of pathogens mineral transport and immune competence are affected by membranefluidity.Oleic acid is a major energy source for cells.  Oleic acid is catabolized to acetyl groups used for energy (ATP)production and biosynthesis of many essential metabolites.Oleic acid is obtained by cells from endogenous biosynthesis or from serum triglycerides.  Biosynthesis of fattyacids (like oleic acid) utilizes the same enzymes responsible for elongation of other fatty acids which are precursorsfor eicosanoids (prostaglandins).  Thus deficient oleic acid status may also indicate deficient eicosanoidproduction signifying a need for essential fatty acids.Deficiency Symptoms:No deficiency symptoms are clearly defined for oleic acid since a dietary intake is not absolutely essential.Monounsaturated fat intake may be beneficial for reducing high blood cholesterol levels.  A need for oleic acidmay possibly reflect a need for essential fatty acids (linoleic acid linolenic acid) or omega-3 fatty acids (alphalinolenic acid EPA and DHA).Repletion Information:Dietary sources rich in Oleic Acid include:Canola OilOlive OilAvocado OilAlmond OilAvocadosHigh Oleic Safflower OilAlthough some margarines and shortenings are high in monounsaturated fats a considerable amount is in the formof trans-monosaturated isomers (elaidic acid).  Reductions in these foods are recommended to improve oleic acidstatus.No RDA exists for oleic acid.  No overt toxicity for fats rich in oleic acid is known except for a laxative effectwhen consumed in large amounts (>50-100 grams per serving).  Daily doses of 1-2 tablespoons of oleic-rich oils(olive canola avocado) are usually adequate to add significant dietary amounts of oleic acid.Although flaxseed oil (edible linseed oil) contains little oleic acid it is an excellent source of the essential fattyacids linoleic acid and linolenic (omega-3) acid.  Daily doses of 1-2 tablespoons per day will provide sufficientessential fatty acids to prevent essential fatty acid deficiencies.

train/misc/ ,         The Microbiology department of Laboratory Alliance of Central New York offers a highly sensitive molecular-based nucleic acid amplification assay for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in urine urethral and/or endocervical samples.  This assay replaced the  former probe test for these organisms.  Clinical Significance: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) are the two most common bacterial causes of sexually transmitted diseases worldwide.  In the United States CT and GC account for about 4 million and 2 million annual cases of genital infection respectively.  Importantly 20% of males and 40% of females are co-infected with both organisms.  Individuals with CT or GC infection may present with asymptomatic disease.  Undiagnosed and untreated symptomatic and asymptomatic infections can lead to disseminated infection in males and pelvic inflammatory disease in females resulting in infertility ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain.  The CT and GC Direct Amplified Test is a gene amplification based technology that represents one of the most sensitive methods for the detection of CT and GC in urogenital samples.  This test has the important added advantage that patient urine samples may be used to reliably screen for the presence of CT and GC.  As shown in the following table clinical studies have shown that the Chlamydia/GC Assay is the most sensitive method available for detecting CT and GC infections and that urine specimens may be used to reliably screen both male and female patients for symptomatic or asymptomatic urogenital infections.

ONG M.D KIM WANG M.D.    NOTE: C. Multiple levels were examined.  The polyp is a sessile serrated adenoma with low grade dysplasia.    Colonic mucosal sessile serrated adenomas (sessile serrated polyps) have a unique histologic appearance. The importance of this diagnosis is that there is an increased association of this type of polyp with microsatellite instability (MSI) adenocarcinoma of the colon. These polyps often sessile grossly should be completely removed. If there is adjacent frank adenomatous change in the polyp a more aggressive approach might be warranted including reducing the colonoscopic surveillance interval.    GROSS DESCRIPTION: MS:kg   A.

The provider must refer to the complete Pap test report or the clinical laboratory report for these items.   This summary ONLY includes results of Pap tests or molecular tests performed by DPMG and does not include results from other institutions or laboratories.    The PAP smear is a screening test for cervical cancer with an inherent and irreducible false negative rate the consequences of which may be minimized by obtaining regular annual PAP smears.  *The LDT CV assay detects the presence of Candida Species RNA (C. albicans C. tropicalis C. dubliniensis and C. parapsilosis) by Real-Time Transcription Mediated Amplification. *The LDT CV Assay detects the presence of Candida glabrata RNA by Real-Time Transcription Mediated Amplification. *The LDT BV Assay detects the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus Spp. (L. jensenii L. crispatus and L. gasseri) RNA by Real-Time Transcription Mediated Amplification.  For cases in which the Gardnerella vaginalis result is indeterminate the presence or absence of Lactobacillus RNA is used as a secondary criteria for interpretation.   Note:  Results depend on sufficient levels of RNA to be detected absence of inhibitors and adequate specimen collection.  Results of any assay should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical findings and should not preclude additional studies if results do not correlate.

A process is established for the processing rejection notification and documentation as well as the disposition of unacceptable specimens.  The laboratory only accepts specimens for testing from (or under the supervision of) licensed physicians Pharmacists Nurse Practitioners (NP) and/or Physician Assistants (PA).This procedure provides acceptance criteria and instructions on how to reject laboratory specimens that do not meet the proper criteria.  Possible exceptions should always be explored before specimen rejection decision.LABELING CRITERIA – All labeling should be legible.Inpatients/Outpatients - The laboratory follows labeling requirements set forth by the Hospital Policy: Collection of Specimens for Laboratory Testing.  Patients should be identified using two separate unique identifiers prior to collection and specimens should be labeled at the time and in the location of the collection (e.g at the bedside).Specimen Labeling Requirements:Patient’s First and Last Name (or Trauma number)Medical Record Number Source and body site of specimen if not bloodOptional: Location or Room NumberNote: Blood Bank specimen collection must follow Memorial Hospital Blood Bank labeling policy. See the Blood Bank Armbands: Recipient Identification System policy. Specimens collected for non-transfusion testing such as prenatal testing and RHIG testing ae not labeled with an armband.

Page 1 of 9Courier/Client Services - The appropriate request form must accompany all clinical specimens sent to Memorial Hospital Laboratory for analysis.  Patient identification information must be listed on both the specimen and the request form and must match.  The request form must be completely and legibly filled out to ensure proper processing and billing of each patient’s laboratory tests.  To comply with hospital and The Joint Commission (TJC) standards 2 patient identifiers must be on all specimens submitted.Minimum Labeling Requirements (should be on both the request form and the specimen):Patient’s Last Name and First Name Date of Birth (or social security number)Additional Labeling Requirements (may be on either the request form or the specimen):Tests requestedPatient’s GenderDate and Time of Collection when appropriateOrdering Physician's Name and AddressSource of Specimen when appropriateDiagnosis / ICD10 CodeOptional: Initials of person collecting or processing the specimen   Histology Labeling Requirements (all patient types):Specimen container requirements (NOT LID):o    Patient Name (First and Last prefer Middle Int.)o    Medical Record and Financial Numbers (if hospital patient)o    Specimen Site/ Description/Laterality (left right or bilateral if appropriate)o    Date/Time of collection/Initials of collectorSpecimen requisition form requirements:o    Must accompany all specimens and all information must match exactly.o    Patient's name (first last and middle initial)o    Patient's birth date and gendero    Medical Record and Financial numbers (if hospital patient)o    Copy of insurance forms (if courier patient)o    Tissue site(s) list individually - take care to match exactly with       specimens containers.o    Surgeon (first and last name)o    Additional physician(s) (first and last names)o    Operating room number (when appropriate)o    Clinical information - pre-operative and post-operative o    Date & time (where appropriate) of collectiono    Other appropriate information – phone #’s if stat call back is requested.

Page 2 of 9SPECIMEN CRITERIASpecimen Type and Source – testing can only be performed on approved specimens and/or sources.  Testing can also only be performed using approved and validated test methods.Specimen Integrity – To ensure result accuracy specimen integrity must be considered.Hemolysis (especially if specimen is to be used for calcium magnesium phosphorus potassium and enzymes). Clotted Specimens (when the test requires whole blood or plasma).Contamination:o    Specimens cannot be collected from an arm with an I.V. running.  If it is impossible to obtain blood from another site then blood may be removed from a site below the I.V. and a notation made on tube (be sure the notation is visible and not covered by any labels).o    The laboratory will not accept specimens that have gross external contamination.  Specimen containers must be tightly sealed with no external spillage.  Specimens should be placed in a sealed plastic biohazard bag for transportation to the laboratory.  Specimen Quantity - Insufficient quantity of specimen for the test ordered may be a cause for rejection.  Refer to the specific test criteria for minimum quantities that may apply.Specimen Handling  The use of improper transport media or collection device may result in an unacceptable specimen.  Carefully refer to the test criteria for appropriate collection materials (this includes all send out testing).  Delays in transportation and/or processing may cause inaccurate results rendering the specimen unacceptable.  Refer to the specific test criteria carefully for any time restrictions that may apply (See the laboratory test catalog).  Some examples of time/processing restrictions include but are not limited to:o    Blood gases at room temperature must be delivered to Chemistry within 30 minutes (Ammonias must be placed on ice and delivered within 30 minutes).o    Heparin or serum vacutainer tubes must be spun within an hour of collection.o    Specimens that must be frozen must be done so within 2 hours of collection.o    Separator tubes must be centrifuged in such a way that the gel will create a barrier between cells and serum.Approved and current.

Page 3 of 9REJECTION PROTOCOLLabeling - Specimens that do not meet labeling criteria listed above may be rejected.  The Laboratory may reject unlabeled or mislabeled specimens to include arm-banded blood bank specimens and specimens where the patient label does not agree with the name on the requisition and request a redraw in most cases.  Possible exceptions listed below should always be explored before rejecting a specimen.  All questions or concerns about rejections and exceptions should be directed to either the charge technologist and/or the appropriate pathologist.  Memorial Hospital Laboratory will recognize and accept samples from known and documented aliases.   Specimens that are eligible to be relabeled may be done so by the individual who collected or was present at the collection of the specimen.  This person must sign and date the Laboratory Specimen Identification Exception Form and the laboratory staff member must enter a comment in the LIS computer documenting that the specimen was relabeled.  If no individual is willing to relabel the specimen the test is cancelled and documented per the rejection policy. Please note that some exceptions will require a Planned Deviation Form to be signed by a pathologist.  These include but are not limited to Blood Bank specimens and Gynecological Cytology specimens.  Questions and concerns over these specimens should be directed to the appropriate pathologist.Exceptions are limited to:Microtainers: These devices are too small for both patient name and ID#. Concerns should be directed to the appropriate charge technologist.Irretrievable specimenso    Some examples of irretrievable specimens include but are not limited to: Blood cultures collected prior to the administration of antibiotics.Intraoperative cultures.Arterial blood gases collected by arterial puncture (not from an IV) (analyze specimen but do not release results until labeling problem is corrected).Cord blood gases collected in utero.Fetal Fibronectin Amnisure and/or other amniotic specimens.Other specimens as determined by the section supervisor or charge technologist.o    Note : Most anatomical pathology specimens are considered irretrievable; every effort should be made to gain the missing elements for documentation so that testing can proceed.  Any concerns related to these exceptions should be directed to a pathologist. Examples are:Tissue from any source.Body fluids (CSF amniotic pleural peritoneal synovial etc.)Approved and current.

Page 4 of 9o    Specimen – Specimens that do not meet specific test criteria may be rejected to include but not limited to:Hemolysis: All adults must be redrawn.  For hemolyzed baby specimens (from NICU and premature infants less than 8 pounds) consult the physician/nurse to determine whether or not a specimen can/will be redrawn.Clotted Specimens: EDTA tubes for CBCs sedimentation rates reticulocytes and Citrated tubes for coagulation tests must be recollected.Contaminated specimens must be redrawn.o    Specimens cannot be collected from an arm with an I.V. running.  If it is impossible to obtain blood from another site then blood may be removed from a site below the I.V. and a notation made on tube.o    Urine that is grossly bloody or contaminated with stool may be unsuitable.o    The laboratory may not accept specimens that have gross external contamination.  Specimen containers must be tightly sealed with no external spillage.  Specimens should be placed in a sealed plastic biohazard bag for transportation to the laboratory.  Exceptions are as follows:o    A physician/nurse can pursue the testing of an unacceptable specimen.  In this case the results of testing must include the applicable comment to indicate that the exception may lead to a compromised result. o    A physician requests an unusual test or a test on a specimen that is not listed as being acceptable.  In this case a pathologist must approve the testing and the methodology that will be used and a Plan Deviation Form must be filled out.NOTIFICATION & DOCUMENTION - Required for any/all specimens that are either rejected or accepted as suboptimal.Notification Any laboratory staff that identifies an unacceptable specimen that requires rejection will document the reason for rejection in the LIS.All laboratory staff is responsible for contacting either a licensed caregiver (inpatients/outpatients) or the off-site physician or physician’s office (courier) to provide notification of the unacceptable specimen.Laboratory staff member must document who provided the notification who received the notification and the date/time in the LIS.DocumentationWhen requesting a redraw due to specimen rejection and/or when reporting results on suboptimal specimens document communication that took place using the communication log contact section for that specific order.  Refer to the non-conforming events policy for reporting rejection or problems with sample submission.

A dry swab may need to be recollected.  Refer to the instructions on the packages of Culturette and anaerobic swabs for proper handling after collection to ensure the viability of any organisms that may be present.Transport Temperature: Bacteria are often sensitive to temperature variations.  Please check with each culture type what the appropriate temperature is best for transporting the specimen.  Because improper storage or transportation temperatures may result in a lack of organism growth specimens may be rejected.Internal Contamination with Stool:Urine specimens for culture that are contaminated with stool will be rejected.Barium in Stool:The presence of barium or similar substances in stool significantly interferes with the microscopic examination for ova and parasites.  Specimens containing barium will be rejected.  Patients who have received barium should not attempt ova and parasite examination for a minimum of 1 week following the treatment.Viral History : Suspected viruses diagnosis and patient history can be found in the hospital electronic medical record or on a paper laboratory requisition if specimen is from outpatient/courier/client services. Charcoal Swabs:Charcoal interferes with microscopic examination of gram stains. Specimens received for gram stain in a charcoal transport system will be rejected.Rotavirus:Requires a pea-size stool sample.  Rectal swabs are unacceptable.   Stool scrapings on a stick that do not meet the minimum volume will be rejected. Approved and current. Effective starting 12/29/2016.

train/misc/ , - 1 -  SAMPLE (All names and details provided in this sample are fictitious.  Some fields have been deliberately left blank.)   MEDICAL REPORT  SECTION 1: PATIENT’S PARTICULARS  Full name of patient: Mr Tan Ah Kow  NRIC/FIN/Passport no. of patient: S1111111X  Age of patient: 55 years old  SECTION 2: DOCTOR’S PARTICULARS  Full name of doctor: Tan Ah Moi  NRIC/FIN/Passport no. of doctor: S2222222Z    MCR no. of doctor: 333333  Hospital / Clinic name and address: 1 Blackacre Hospital Singapore 01010101    Doctor’s qualifications and experience in this area of work:   [To set out details]        - 2 -   Doctor-patient relationship:  Please state if you have been seeing the patient regularly over a period of time (if so please  state  when  you  first  started  seeing  the  patient  and  how  often  you  see  the patient) or if you saw the patient specifically for this mental capacity assessment only.   I have been the doctor in charge of Mr Tan Ah Kow since November 2010. I have seen Mr Tan regularly since then on average once or twice a year. For purposes of this medical report I re-examined Mr Tan on 20 June 2015.          SECTION 3: PATIENT’S MEDICAL INFORMATION   Patient’s clinical history:  Please  also  state  the  source  of  the  information  (e.g.  from  medical  records from  the patient from the applicant etc.).  Mr Tan Ah Kow was accompanied by his son Mr Tan Ah Beng for the examination. Mr Tan is a 55 year old man who is divorced and unemployed. Mr Tan is currently living with his son Ah Beng in Ah Beng’s flat. Mr Tan Ah Beng informed me that Mr Tan Ah Kow used to work as a cleaner.  Mr Tan Ah Kow has a history of medical conditions. He has had hypertension and hyperlipidemia since 1990 and suffered several strokes in 2005. He subsequently developed heart problems (cardiomyopathy) cardiac failure and chronic renal disease and was treated in ABC Hospital.  He was last admitted to the ABC Hospital on 1 April 2010 till 15 April 2010 during which he was diagnosed to have suffered from a stroke. This was confirmed by CT and MRI brain scans.   Thereafter he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for stroke rehabilitation on 15 April 2010.   After that Mr Tan was referred to Blackacre Hospital for follow-up treatment from in November 2010. The clinical impression was that he was manifesting behavioural and psychological symptoms secondary to Dementia.  - 3 -  The clinical impression was that he was manifesting behavioural and psychological symptoms secondary to Dementia.  I was informed by Mr Tan Ah Beng that Mr Tan is at present incontinent and is unable to bathe or use the toilet on his own. He is however able to feed himself.  I have observed a gradual deterioration in his cognitive ability and physical state over the years.    Findings from physical examination / mental state examination:  Please  state  your  observations  of  the  patient  (i.e.  the  patient’s  demeanour  body language tone  of  voice  etc.  relevant  to  your  assessment)  the  interactions  you  had with the patient/the tests you administered/the questions you posed and the date you examined the patient.   Mr Tan was brought to the clinic in a wheel chair. His mood was euthymic (i.e. normal non-depressed and reasonably positive mood) and he did not have any psychotic symptoms.   Orientation to time place and person  With regard to his orientation to time place and person he was unable to tell that he was in a hospital clinic but identified his son and was able to tell his own name and the name of his son. After being told he was in a hospital clinic he identified me as a doctor when asked. However he could not remember my name although I have been treating him for the last 5 years. He was able to tell correctly how he arrived at the clinic. However when asked some moments later where he was he said he did not know.   He said that it was 10 February (actual date 20 June) and it was a Wednesday (actual day Monday). He appeared to be just guessing as to what date and day it was. After being told what the day and date were he forgot a few moments later after being asked again. He could not answer when asked what year it was.  When asked what time it was he said that it was 5pm in the afternoon (actual time 3pm). He was not able to tell the time from looking at a watch.   Basic information  He gave his age as 50 years old (actually 55 years) and could not answer when asked when his birthday was. He correctly said he lived in a flat with his son but could not give the correct address and also got the area wrong (he said the flat was in Bedok when it was actually in Jurong.) He incorrectly stated that the Prime Minister was Lee Kuan Yew. - 4 -   Simple arithmetic financial issues  Mr Tan was unable to perform simple arithmetic such as 4 plus 3 giving 8 as the answer and could not subtract 7 from 10. He could not count backwards from 20 to 1. He was unable to recognise notes or coins (he identified a 50-cent coin as 20 cents and a 10-dollar note as 2 dollars).  Personal welfare/property and affairs related questions  I asked Mr Tan if he owned any property. Mr Tan said he did. I asked him if he was the sole owner. He said yes. (However Mr Tan Ah Beng informed me that Mr Tan owned the flat together with his (Mr Tan’s) elderly mother in joint names and that the elderly mother was currently living in the flat by herself.) I asked Mr Tan what the address of the flat was. He said he could not remember. I asked how many rooms the flat had and he said it was a 4-room flat. (However Mr Tan Ah Beng said it was a 3-room flat.) I asked Mr Tan what he wanted to do with the flat since he was not staying there. He said that he wanted to rent it out. I asked him whether he planned to rent out the whole flat. Mr Tan said yes (even though his elderly mother was still living there.) I asked him how much rent he planned to charge Mr Tan said he did not know and that he was not good at money matters.   I asked him whether he knew what medical problems he had. Mr Tan just stared at me blankly and shook his head. I asked him whether he remembered being in hospital before. Mr Tan nodded. I asked him if he knew what he was in hospital for. Mr Tan shook his head. I asked him if he was taking any medicine at the moment. Mr Tan just looked at me blankly and did not reply.  Date of physical examination/mental state examination: 20 June 2015   Relevant investigation results:  [Results of CT brain MRI brain scan and other investigations to be stated.]       - 5 -  Diagnosis: 1. Dementia  2. Stroke                  SECTION 4: OPINION ON PATIENT’S MENTAL CAPACITY  OPINION  ON  PATIENT’S  MENTAL  CAPACITY  IN  RELATION  TO PERSONAL WELFARE  In  your  opinion  can  the  patient  understand  information  relevant  to  a  decision relating to his or her personal welfare?   Yes  No  In  your  opinion  can  the  patient  retain  information  long  enough  to  make  a decision relating to his or her personal welfare?   Yes            No  In your opinion can the patient weigh information as part of the process of - 6 -  making a decision relating to his or her personal welfare?   Yes  No  In your opinion can the patient communicate his or her decision relating to his or her personal welfare?  Yes            No                Taking into consideration the above in your opinion does the patient have mental capacity in respect of personal welfare?   Yes   No   OPINION ON PATIENT’S MENTAL CAPACITY IN RELATION TO PROPERTY AND AFFAIRS  In your opinion can the patient understand information relevant to a decision relating to his or her property and affairs?   Yes  No  In your opinion can the patient retain information long enough to make a decision relating to his or her property and affairs?   Yes  No  In your opinion can the patient weigh information as part of the process of making a decision relating to his or her property and affairs?   Yes  No  In your opinion can the patient communicate his or her decision relating to his or her property and affairs?  Yes No  Taking into consideration the above in your opinion does the patient have mental capacity in respect of property and affairs?   Yes No  - 7 -   Please state the basis of your opinion above in respect of the patient’s mental capacity:  Mr Tan’s dementia and stroke have impaired the functioning of his mind and brain. His failure to remember where he was (i.e. in the hospital) and the day and date despite being told a short while ago shows his inability to retain information.  He was also not able to remember basic information such as his age and the address where he lives.  His failure to tell the time from a watch or to recognize notes and coins shows his inability to understand simple information.   He could not do basic arithmetic which shows that he is not able to weigh and use information.   Since he is unable to understand retain use or weigh simple information due to his memory deficits and cognitive failures he will not be able to make decisions about his personal and financial affairs which would require being able to process such information. This is also demonstrated by his inability to remember basic information on the property he owns with his elderly mother and also his inability to make a realistic and concrete plan for what to do with the property. He was also not able to remember what medical problems he has and not able to answer a question as to whether he is currently on medication.  In my view his cognitive functions are unlikely to improve and would most likely get worse over time as there is no treatment which can reverse his dementia.                     - 8 -     Are  you  aware  of  any  other  doctor  who  holds  a  different  professional  opinion regarding the patient’s mental capacity? If so please provide details:   No.        PROGNOSIS  In your opinion is the patient likely to regain mental capacity?   Yes  No         Not Sure  If “Yes” or “Not Sure” please suggest when another assessment of the patient’s mental capacity should be carried out:                        In your opinion would the patient understand if he/she were to be informed of this application?  Yes             No  - 9 -   SECTION 5: DECLARATION   I  have  read  and  understood  the  provisions  in  sections  3  4  and  5  of  the  Mental Capacity Act.  I believe in the correctness of the opinion set out herein.  I understand that in giving this report my duty is to the Court and I confirm that I have complied with this duty.       Signature: _[Doctor to sign]_________  Name: ______Dr Tan Ah Moi____  Date: ______20 July 2015________   Explanatory notes:  1. “Personal welfare” refers to matters such as deciding where to live and consenting to medical and dental treatment.  2. “Property  and  affairs”  as  the  name  implies  refers  to  matters  concerning  the  patient’s  financial affairs and property.   3. When giving your opinion on the patient’s mental capacity please note that where it is not patently obvious  from  the  clinical  history  and  examination  that  the  patient  has  or  lacks  capacity  you  will need to explain the basis for your opinion.    Section 3 of the Mental Capacity Act  (1) The following principles apply for the purposes of this Act.   (2) A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity.   (3) A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success.   (4) A  person  is  not  to  be  treated  as  unable  to  make  a  decision  merely  because  he  makes  an  unwise decision.   (5) An act done or a decision made under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done or made in his best interests.   (6) Before the act is done or the decision is made regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.    Section 4 of the Mental Capacity Act  (1) For the purposes of this Act a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time he is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of or a - 10 -  disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain.  (2) It does not matter whether the impairment or disturbance is permanent or temporary.   (3) A lack of capacity cannot be established merely by reference to —   (a) a person’s age or appearance; or   (b) a condition of his or an aspect of his behaviour which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about his capacity.  (4) In  proceedings  under  this  Act  (other  than  proceedings  for  offences  under  this  Act)  any  question whether  a  person  lacks  capacity  within  the  meaning  of this  Act  must  be  decided on  the  balance of probabilities.  (5) Subject to section 21 no power which a person (“D”) may exercise under this Act —  (a) in relation to a person who lacks capacity; or  (b) where D reasonably thinks that a person lacks capacity   is exercisable in relation to a person below 21 years of age.   Section 5 of the Mental Capacity Act  (1) For the purposes of section 4 a person is unable to make a decision for himself if he is unable—  (a) to understand the information relevant to the decision; (b) to retain that information; (c) to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or  (d) to communicate his decision (whether by talking using sign language or any other means).  (2) A person is not to be regarded as unable to understand the information relevant to a decision if he is able  to  understand  an  explanation  of  it  given  to  him  in  a  way  that  is  appropriate  to  his circumstances (using simple language visual aids or any other means).   (3) The fact that a person is able to retain the information relevant to a decision for a short period only does not prevent him from being regarded as able to make the decision.   (4) The  information  relevant  to  a  decision  includes  information  about  the  reasonably  foreseeable consequences of —  (a) deciding one way or another; or (b) failing to make the decision.

train/misc/ ,  1 Washington State Health Insurance Pool 10-01-09 (Page 2 & 3 Revised 032312)   STANDARD HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE FOR WASHINGTON STATE Use for Individual Coverage Beginning On or After October 1 2009 Revised for Coverage Beginning on or after March 23 2012   Important Information Before You Start  Washington law allows private health carriers to require a person applying for an individual policy to complete the attached Standard Health Questionnaire and requires persons applying for nonsubsidized enrollment in the Basic Health Plan to complete the questionnaire if they do not qualify for an exemption.  For purposes of this questionnaire subsequent references to “health carrier” include the Health Care Authority when administering the nonsubsidized Basic Health Plan.   Under some circumstances you may be exempt from taking the questionnaire. (See pages 2. & 3.)  The Standard Health Questionnaire was created by the Washington State Health Insurance Pool (WSHIP).  It is the only health screening allowed by law for health carriers to use if they wish to screen for health conditions as a part of their determination of eligibility of people who apply for private individual medical coverage.  Those rejected for medical coverage due to their score on the Standard Health Questionnaire are eligible for WSHIP coverage.  WSHIP was created by the Washington State Legislature to provide health coverage to those rejected for individual medical coverage or to those unable to obtain comprehensive coverage on either an individual or group basis.  Health carriers may use the Standard Health Questionnaire as a health screening tool for products such as stand-alone prescription drug plans disability income replacement or life insurance policies sold by the health carrier.  Use of the Standard Health Questionnaire for these kinds of products does not guarantee the right to coverage with the Washington State Health Insurance Pool if an applicant is denied coverage for one of these products.  The Standard Health Questionnaire is available from private health carriers on paper as a part of their application packet or electronically for those applying for coverage on-line.  Attention:  If you are currently eligible for Medicare or will be on the requested effective date of coverage for which you are applying you are not eligible for private individual or family health coverage; and you should not fill out this questionnaire.  Medicare is a federally sponsored program for individuals age 65 or older or who have end-stage renal disease or are disabled as defined by Social Security.  Medicare and Medicaid are different.  Medicaid is a state-sponsored program for individuals and families who qualify based on income and other criteria. Need Help in Answering this Questionnaire?  Contact the health carrier that you are submitting your application to; or  Contact your insurance agent; or if you do not have an agent use the WSHIP Agent Directory to locate an agent who is knowledgeable about the questionnaire.  Request a copy of the Agent list from the health carrier to whom you are applying or go to www.wship.org   2 Washington State Health Insurance Pool 10-01-09 (Page 2 & 3 Revised 032312)  ARE YOU EXEMPT FROM TAKING THIS QUESTIONNAIRE?

These definitions will help you fill out the questionnaire if you do not understand any terms used.    Acute (as opposed to Chronic):  An illness typically with a sudden onset and resolving after a single course of treatment or therapy.  Many are infectious in origin.  Examples include pneumonia gastritis urinary tract infection and minor trauma not requiring surgery.   Benign (as opposed to Malignant):  A mild and non-progressive form of a disease.   Chronic (as opposed to Acute):  A continuing illness that may or may not improve over time.  Chronic illnesses can last from weeks to years. Examples include heart failure COPD leukemia and many of the psychiatric illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia.   Congenital:  A condition that existed at birth.  This condition may be inherited or may have developed in the womb.  Although the condition existed at birth it may not be discovered until later in life.   Diagnosed:  A licensed physician or medical professional has identified a specific disease or medical condition.   Malignant (as opposed to Benign):  A severe and progressively worsening form of a disease.   Medicated:  A drug prescribed by a licensed physician or other licensed medical professional has been taken for the treatment of a medical (including mental) condition.   Monitored:  A licensed medical professional has assessed the state of an existing or previously diagnosed disease or condition possibly including diagnostic tests or imaging.  A specific condition must first be diagnosed to be monitored.  Monitoring does not include routine preventive screenings that are recommended for the general population in the absence of disease such as annual mammograms for women.   Physical Trauma:  An injury to any tissue by physical or chemical means.  This may include abrasions lacerations incisions or stab puncture or bullet wounds.  When trauma occurs to the bone this can result in fractures dislocations or sprains.  Trauma can also be the result of exposure to toxic chemicals high heat irradiation or electrical shock causing damage to tissues and organs.     Treated:  A licensed physician or other licensed medical professional has recommended a course of action or performed services to remedy a disease.

Cancer or Benign Tumors Cancer (malignancy) develops when cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control. Although there are many kinds of cancer they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. Sometimes these cells form tumors which are abnormal growths of body tissues. Not all tumors are cancerous.  Benign tumors can also be referred to as cysts polyps or dysplasia.

Circulatory Blood or Heart Conditions Our vascular system is made up of blood vessels which are part of our circulatory or cardiovascular system that works with the beating heart. With each beat the heart pumps blood into the vessels and throughout the body providing nutrients and oxygen to cells. The circulating blood removes waste products toxins and other harmful substances. Our circulatory system is critical to many body functions especially our respiratory or lung function digestion waste removal and body temperature. Medical conditions can occur when these systems are not working properly.

Digestive Conditions When you eat your body breaks food down to a form it can use to build and nourish cells and provide energy. This process is called digestion. Your digestive system is a series of hollow organs joined in a long twisting tube. It runs from your mouth to your anus and includes your esophagus stomach and small and large intestines. Your liver gallbladder and pancreas are also involved. They produce juices to help digestion. There are many types of digestive disorders and conditions. The symptoms vary widely depending on the problem. Have you been diagnosed treated medicated and/or monitored for any of the conditions listed in the table below within the time frame specified?

Endocrine Lymphatic or Metabolic Conditions The foundations of the endocrine system are the hormones and glands. As the body's chemical messengers hormones transfer information and instructions from one set of cells to another. Too much or too little of any hormone can be harmful to your body. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps your body fluids in balance. Lymph vessels which are different from blood vessels carry fluid called lymph throughout your body. If your lymphatic system is not working properly fluid builds in your tissues and causes swelling. Other lymphatic system problems can include infections blockage and cancer. Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. Chemicals in your digestive system break the food parts down into sugars and acids your body's fuel. A metabolic disorder occurs when abnormal chemical reactions in your body disrupt this process.

train/misc/ , Sample 2012 Name and Address of Agency which Holds the Limited Test Site Permit” Rapid HIV Antibody Test Result   Client Name/ID # ___________________ Collection Date: ___/___/_____   Tester Initials:_______  Clients Date of Birth: ___/___/____  Race: ___________   Gender:_________  Name of Authorizing Physician_______ _____________________________________  The HIV-1/2 antibody result from the Rapid HIV Antibody Test is:  Non-Reactive (Negative) Reactive (Preliminary Positive)  Invalid ❑ ❑ ❑  Type of Specimen:    Rapid test finger stick with whole blood   ❑                                     Oral            Fluid            Specimen                                                            ❑  Meaning of the test result:  A non-reactive (negative) test result means that no antibodies to HIV-1 have been detected.  HIV antibodies may be absent during the “window period” of infection.  Follow-up testing may be necessary if indicated by risk factors.    A reactive (preliminary positive) test result suggests that antibodies to HIV-1  may be present in the blood obtained from a rapid finger stick test with whole blood.  A specimen will have to be sent to a laboratory for a Western Blot test prior to confirmation of the reactive test result.  Precautions should be taken to avoid the chance of spreading HIV.    An invalid test result resulting from a rapid finger stick can be due to a problem running the test or an interfering substance in the specimen.  A specimen using other testing technology should be collected and submitted to a laboratory for HIV testing.  Questions: If you have any questions about the rapid test result please contact the Authorizing Physician.
